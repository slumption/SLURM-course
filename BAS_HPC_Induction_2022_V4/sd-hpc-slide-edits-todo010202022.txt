Notes

Service desk solutions

- Check we have solutions for all of the demos
- Check that they have been tested/reviewed recently

Part 1: Diagram change login node to login node/workstation

Part 3: Jump hosts diagram, amend so that it shows BAS office as not needing a proxy. 

SSH: explain what SSH is

SD solutions: 

X2go setting up (Linux, Windows and Mac) https://servicedesk.bas.ac.uk/app/itdesk/ui/solutions/60624000019605299/details

Setting up SSH access (Putty only, as Mac and Linux have a terminal)

Setting up SSH keys (putty plus Linux/Mac)

Demonstrations

1. X2GO session
2. SSH into a workstation

Excercises

1. Login into BAS workstation, requires user to follow the X2go SD solution

Part 3 access

Need to link to an SD for setting up SFTP, for exercise example might need to be CLI and GUI (user then chooses appropriate one)

Need to explain what SSH keys are (public, private, which key to transfer to the remote host). Might be worth adding a diagram.

SD solution:

SFTP to bslcenb or bslcenc for file tranfers, GUI (Win SFTP or filezilla)
Rsync: check if there is an SD solution or notes in the HPC user guide

Sftp demo
Rsync demo

Part 4: User environment 

After slide TMUX, add a slide for screen
Add a slide for text editors as we refer to this in the exercises

SD solution

Agree with Andy the strongest key type should be using (needs to work on old and new hosts) 
Check http://ictdocs/wiki/index.php/SSH_Keys
Check the SD solution

Demonstration

TMUX, I'd like just refer to the wiki page and demo screen
Add a page and demo of screen as its quite easy to use

Exercises

Exercise 2: Opening a termining and some simple commands (ls, df, myquota etc)
Exercise 3: a) Command line SFTP and b) command line based SFTP
Exercise 4: Transfer files with rsync (need to write this)
Exercise 5: Text editors
Exercise 6: Modules and Compilers, Matlab exercise

Part 5: SLURM

Slides

Need some slides to explain array jobs

Demonstrations

Submitting a SLURM script
Monitoring a SLURM job
SLURM array jobs

Exercise 7: SLURM submit script
Exercise 8: SLURM script, R module
Exercise 9: SLURM Array jobs
